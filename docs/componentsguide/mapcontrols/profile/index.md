## Properties

### Props from OpenLayers

Properties are passed-trough from `ol-ext` directly.
Their types and default values can be checked-out [in the official OpenLayers docs: `ol-ext/control/Profile`](https://viglino.github.io/ol-ext/doc/doc-pages/ol.control.Profile.html).
Only some properties deviate caused by reserved keywords from Vue / HTML.
This deviating props are described in the section below.
