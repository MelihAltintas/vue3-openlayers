# [1.0.0](https://github.com/MelihAltintas/vue3-openlayers/compare/v0.5.1...v1.0.0) (2023-07-11)

Version `1.0.0` was completely refactored and aligned with the features and also **BREAKING CHANGES** from OpenLayers 7.x.x.
Please be sure to checkout the [Changelog](https://github.com/openlayers/openlayers/releases/) of OpenLayers as well.
Properties are mostly reflected 1:1 from OpenLayers as Component Properties for the related `vue3-openlayers` components. The same applies for the default values. Deviating properties with their values and description are listed in the [documentation](https://vue3openlayers.netlify.app/) for each component.

- üß© added new components: `ol-layer-group`, `ol-source-tile-json`, `ol-source-stadia-maps` and `ol-vector-image-layer`
- üöÄ expose all interactions to be able to call access them via `ref` in templates
- üêû lot's of bug fixes

## Compability

Please be sure to install the following peerDependencies in your project:

```
"ol": "^7.4.0",
"ol-contextmenu": "^5.2.1",
"ol-ext": "^4.0.8"
```

## Breaking Changes

**general**: dropped support for Openlayers 6 and below. Please use Openlayers 7.x.x

**general**: lot's of property types have been updated to match with the types in Openlayers. This may lead to TypeScript issues that must be fixed. Please [have a look at all Changelog notes from the alpha and next releases](https://github.com/MelihAltintas/vue3-openlayers/releases) before.

**ol-geolocation**: pass-through original events from Openlayers directly and remove legacy events
The following events are not emitted anymore and replaced with the events from Openlayers.
All new events receive a generic [`ObjectEvent`](https://openlayers.org/en/latest/apidoc/module-ol_Object.ObjectEvent.html).
This means, changing only the event name in your templates isn't enough, you must adopt the implementations of the handler functions, so the will receive an `ObjectEvent` as first parameter.

- `positionChanged` -> `change:position`
- `speedChanged` -> `change:speed`
- `headingChanged` -> `change:heading`
- `altitudeChanged` -> `change:altitude`
- `altitudeAccuracyChanged` -> `change:altitudeAccuracy`
- `accuracyGeometryChanged` -> `change:accuracyGeometry`

Please refer to [the official Openlayers docs for Geolocation](https://openlayers.org/en/latest/apidoc/module-ol_Geolocation-Geolocation.html) for details of the emitted event data format.
